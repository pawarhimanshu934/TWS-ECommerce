#   AWS Kubernetes integrations need a way to automatically discover which subnets(Public/Private) to use when creating load balancers. These tags provide that signal.

# Marks subnet as public and k8 will use these subnet for internet facing load balancers (ELB)
# Example:
# When you create a Service of type LoadBalancer exposed to the internet, AWS will place the ELB in these subnets
  public_subnet_tags = {
    "kubernetes.io/role/elb" = 1

  }

# Marks subnet as private and k8 will use these subnet for internal load balancers (ELB)
# Example:
# Services meant only for internal communication within the VPC, such as a database service, can be exposed using an internal load balancer. AWS will place the ELB in these subnets

    "kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb" = 1

# Why this matters

# Without these tags:

# Kubernetes (via the AWS cloud provider or AWS Load Balancer Controller) cannot automatically discover subnets
# You would need to manually specify subnet IDs every time you create a LoadBalancer service, which is error-prone and less scalable
# With these tags:  
# Kubernetes can automatically discover which subnets to use for internet-facing and internal load balancers, simplifying the deployment of services and improving scalability.
